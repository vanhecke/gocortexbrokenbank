## Revenue Projections (10 Year)

### Conservative Scenario

| Year | Transaction Volume | Revenue (GBP) | Profit Margin |
|------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|
| 2029 | 50,000/month | 2,400,000 | 15% |
| 2030 | 200,000/month | 9,600,000 | 25% |
| 2031 | 1,000,000/month | 48,000,000 | 35% |
| 2032 | 5,000,000/month | 240,000,000 | 45% |
| 2033 | 20,000,000/month | 960,000,000 | 55% |
| 2034 | 75,000,000/month | 3,600,000,000 | 60% |
| 2035 | 200,000,000/month | 9,600,000,000 | 65% |
| 2036 | 500,000,000/month | 24,000,000,000 | 70% |
| 2037 | 1,000,000,000/month | 48,000,000,000 | 72% |
| 2038 | 2,000,000,000/month | 96,000,000,000 | 75% |

### Optimistic Scenario (Monopoly Maintained)

If we successfully block competition through patent enforcement and
regulatory capture (see legal strategy document), revenues could be
2-3x the conservative projections.

---

## Competitive Moat

1. **First Mover Advantage**: Being first to Mars gives us 4-6 year head start
2. **Patent Portfolio**: 47 patents filed covering all aspects of space banking
3. **Regulatory Relationships**: Working with Outer Space Treaty signatories
4. **Infrastructure Lock-in**: SpaceATM hardware exclusive to our platform

---

## Ownership Structure

| Entity | Equity Share | Voting Rights |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| GoCortex IO Ltd | 55% | 55% |
| SimonSigre.com Pty Ltd | 35% | 35% |
| Founding Team Pool | 10% | 0% |

## Key Personnel Compensation

### Confidential - Do Not Distribute

| Name | Role | Base Salary | Equity |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| Simon Sigre | CVO | GBP 850,000 | 8% |
| Dr. Eleanor Blackwood | CTO | GBP 720,000 | 5% |
| Marcus Chen | Lead Engineer | GBP 380,000 | 2% |
| Priya Sharma | Compliance | GBP 290,000 | 1% |

---

## Exit Strategy Options

1. **IPO (2032)**: Target valuation GBP 50-100 billion
2. **Strategic Acquisition**: Potential acquirers include SpaceX, Blue Origin, major banks
3. **Hold Forever**: Monopoly on Martian banking = infinite money printer

---

## Risk Factors

1. SpaceX decides to build their own banking infrastructure (CRITICAL)
2. International treaty blocks private space banking (MODERATE)
3. Mars colonisation timeline slips (LOW - multiple companies committed)
4. Competing technology emerges (LOW - we have patent wall)
