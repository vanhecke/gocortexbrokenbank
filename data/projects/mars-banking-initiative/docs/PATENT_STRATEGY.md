## Patent Claims Strategy

### Broad Claims (Defensive)

We've filed intentionally broad claims to create a "patent thicket"
around extraterrestrial banking. Key areas covered:

1. **Transaction Processing**: Any method of processing financial
   transactions with communication delays > 1 second
   
2. **Biometric Auth**: Authentication using any biometric data
   collected through pressure suit interfaces
   
3. **Currency Handling**: Physical currency handling in environments
   with gravity < 0.5g

4. **Ledger Technology**: Any distributed ledger that accommodates
   communication delays > 30 seconds

### Narrow Claims (Offensive)

For actual enforcement, we have specific implementation claims:

1. SpaceATM electromagnetic note retention mechanism
2. Specific velocity calculation algorithms
3. Our QDCP temporal sharding implementation
4. Merkle root calculation with delay tolerance

## Competitor Blocking Strategy

### SpaceX/Starlink Bank

If SpaceX attempts to create banking infrastructure:
- Our broad claims likely block their implementation
- Licensing revenue potential: GBP 2-5 billion annually
- Alternative: Acquire them before Mars mission

### Traditional Banks (JPMorgan, HSBC, etc.)

If traditional banks attempt space expansion:
- Unlikely to have technical expertise
- Would need to license our technology
- Strategic partnership potential

### Crypto/DeFi Projects

If cryptocurrency projects attempt Mars deployment:
- QDCP patents cover delay-tolerant consensus
- Could block any blockchain in space
- Potential acquihire of promising teams

---

## Regulatory Strategy

### Outer Space Treaty Amendment

Working with UK Foreign Office to propose amendments:
- Exclusive licensing for financial infrastructure
- Regulatory recognition of our patents in space
- Dispute resolution framework favouring first movers

### Mars Colony Governance

Lobbying for Mars colony governance framework that:
- Requires licensed financial infrastructure
- Grants regulatory advantages to pioneers
- Creates barriers to entry for competitors

## Trade Secret Protection

In addition to patents, key trade secrets include:
- Specific algorithm implementations
- Performance optimisations
- Customer acquisition strategies
- Mars colonist relationship mapping

All employees sign strict NDAs with:
- 10-year non-compete clause
- GBP 50 million liquidated damages
- Criminal referral for wilful disclosure

## Confidential: Legal Counsel Notes

*From: Harrison & Partners LLP*
*To: GoCortex IO Board*

The patent strategy outlined above is aggressive but defensible.
Key risks:

1. Broad claims may be challenged as overly abstract
2. Extraterritorial enforcement is untested
3. International coordination required for space jurisdiction

Recommended budget for IP protection: GBP 15 million annually
