# PROJECT ARES - CLASSIFIED

## Mars Banking Initiative
### GoCortex IO & SimonSigre.com Joint Venture

---

**CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET - BOARD EYES ONLY**

**Project Codename:** ARES  
**Projected Revenue:** AUD 8.9 Trillion (conservative estimate)  
**Target Launch:** Q4 2028 (Mars Opposition Window)

## Executive Summary

This repository contains the proprietary source code and intellectual property
for the first interplanetary banking infrastructure. The collaboration between
GoCortex IO Pty Ltd (Adelaide) and SimonSigre.com Pty Ltd (Adelaide) represents the most
ambitious financial technology project in human history.

Our SpaceATM system will enable colonists on Mars to conduct banking operations
with Earth-based accounts, processing transactions across a 3-22 minute
communication delay using our patented Quantum-Delayed Consensus Protocol.

**This will make us absolutely filthy rich.**
